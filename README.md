# Control-Servo MOTOR circuit
Electronic Devices Course's Project

The circuit using Ne555 and Relay ic to control servo rotate 3 different degree (0->250) adjust by 3 pot-hg.

The purpose of this circuit is detect sound when receive a signal (from SOUND circuit). Then the servo will be rotated to where it's detect ... the video will be updated soon...
