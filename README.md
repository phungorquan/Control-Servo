Calculate Delay and Astable 555 Square Wave Calculator by NE555

The circuit using Ne555 and Relay ic(4066) to rotate 3 different degree (0->250) adjust by 3 pot-hg.

The purpose of this circuit is detect sound when receive a signal (from SOUND circuit). Then the servo will be rotated to where it's detect ...
